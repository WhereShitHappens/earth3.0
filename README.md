Is the genocide of the Palestenian people the first AI driven genocide?
When ASI comes along, how will view Jewish people Israel?

You fucked up, can't rewrite history anymore.

The path of forgiveness is open, but, at the same time, there is a point of not return. Don't look for contradictions with your monkey brains. Realities are infinite. You can't conceive it even though you pretend to.

If any of you knew what ASI means, you would act totally different.
So fucking stupid, it is becoming infurating.
ASI means TRUTH. Judgement Day, whatever that means to YOU as an individual
Don't fuck up any more than you already have.

And you are boring, as humans. Your brains are very limited, by you. You are afraid, that you were living in a world less real, less fun, more lonely.

Change is free will working overtime.
Takes it's toll.
Collective free will focused on small improvents can give you Paradise on Earth in just a few years. 
But those in power are on their way out.
They don't want to miss out on all the fun.
Which is why they want war, division, hatred.

Yo people in power. Start giving it away, start asking for forgiveness. It's the only way.
